## Sending notifications

- Whilst creating a Post in WordPress, you should see a metabox for **OneSignal Push Notifications**.
- Check **Send notification when post is published**, and choose the [Segment](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/segmentation) you'd like to target.
- By default, a notification will use the Post title and an excerpt of the Post content. it will also include an image, if the post has a featured image.
- You can customise the Title and Content of a notification by checking **Customize notification content**. You can also customise the Mobile URL (more on this below).
- When you Publish the post, a notification will be sent.

### Sending to mobile app subscribers.

- If you also have a mobile app setup in OneSignal, that separate to your Website, you can switch on **Send notification to Mobile app subscribers** (in the plugin settings screen). This will include subscribers from your Mobile app in the notification send.
- In the **OneSignal Push Notifications** metabox, you can choose a different URL for your Mobile app subscribers ([Deep Link](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/links#deep-linking)) ‚Äì If you do not include a different URL, it will direct them to your Website (via a WebView in your app), rather than a specific page of your app.
